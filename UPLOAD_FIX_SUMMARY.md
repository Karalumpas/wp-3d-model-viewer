# 3D Model Upload Fix - Technical Summary

## Problem Description
Even though GLB and GLTF settings were activated in the plugin settings page, users were not permitted to upload GLB files through the WordPress media library.

## Root Cause Analysis
The plugin had comprehensive settings for configuring allowed file types, but was missing the crucial WordPress `upload_mimes` filter that actually enables these file types for upload in WordPress.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Global MIME Type Support
**File:** `includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php`
- Added `enable_3d_model_uploads()` method to constructor
- Created `add_3d_model_mime_types()` filter method
- Hooked into WordPress `upload_mimes` filter globally (both admin and frontend)

### 2. Enhanced MIME Type Mapping
**File:** `includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php` - Lines 277-310
```php
public function add_3d_model_mime_types( $mimes ) {
    // Get plugin settings to determine which MIME types to enable
    $options = get_option( 'wp_3d_model_viewer_options' );
    $allowed_mime_types = isset( $options['allowed_mime_types'] ) ? $options['allowed_mime_types'] : array();

    // If no settings exist yet, enable GLB and GLTF by default
    if ( empty( $allowed_mime_types ) ) {
        $allowed_mime_types = array( 'model/gltf-binary', 'model/gltf+json' );
    }

    // Map MIME types to file extensions
    $mime_map = array(
        'model/gltf+json'          => array( 'gltf' ),
        'model/gltf-binary'        => array( 'glb' ),
        'application/octet-stream' => array( 'obj' ),
        'application/x-tgif'       => array( 'fbx' ),
        'model/vnd.collada+xml'    => array( 'dae' ),
        'model/vnd.usdz+zip'       => array( 'usdz' ),
        'model/vnd.pixar.usd'      => array( 'usd' ),
    );

    // Add enabled MIME types to WordPress upload allowlist
    foreach ( $allowed_mime_types as $mime_type ) {
        if ( isset( $mime_map[ $mime_type ] ) ) {
            foreach ( $mime_map[ $mime_type ] as $extension ) {
                $mimes[ $extension ] = $mime_type;
            }
        }
    }

    return $mimes;
}
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Implementation
**File:** `admin/class-wp-3d-model-viewer-admin.php`
- Removed duplicate `add_3d_model_mime_types()` method from admin class
- Removed local filter hook from `admin_init()` method

## Technical Details

### Default Behavior
- **Out of the box:** GLB and GLTF files are enabled by default
- **Configured:** Respects user settings from plugin options page
- **Fallback:** If no settings exist, defaults to GLB (.glb) and GLTF (.gltf) support

### MIME Type Mappings
| File Extension | MIME Type | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| `.glb` | `model/gltf-binary` | GL Transmission Format (Binary) |
| `.gltf` | `model/gltf+json` | GL Transmission Format (JSON) |
| `.obj` | `application/octet-stream` | Wavefront OBJ |
| `.fbx` | `application/x-tgif` | Autodesk FBX |
| `.dae` | `model/vnd.collada+xml` | COLLADA |
| `.usdz` | `model/vnd.usdz+zip` | USD (iOS AR) |
| `.usd` | `model/vnd.pixar.usd` | Universal Scene Description |

### WordPress Integration
- Uses WordPress `upload_mimes` filter hook
- Integrates with existing plugin settings system
- Applies globally (admin, frontend, media library, REST API)
- Respects user permissions and capabilities

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Upload Test
1. Go to Media Library → Add New
2. Try to upload a `.glb` file
3. File should upload successfully without error

### 2. Settings Verification
1. Go to Settings → 3D Viewer
2. Check "File Upload Settings" section
3. Verify GLB and GLTF are checked
4. Save settings and test upload again

### 3. Debug Information
If uploads still fail, check:
- WordPress debug log for MIME type errors
- Server file upload limits (php.ini)
- Server MIME type restrictions (.htaccess)

## Files Modified
1. `includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php` - Added global MIME type support
2. `admin/class-wp-3d-model-viewer-admin.php` - Removed duplicate method

## Compatibility
- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- Works with all WordPress upload methods (Media Library, REST API, Custom uploaders)
- Compatible with multisite installations

## Security Considerations
- MIME type validation based on file extension
- Respects WordPress core security for file uploads
- Uses whitelist approach for allowed file types
- Integrates with existing WordPress file upload security

## Performance Impact
- Minimal - only adds filter hook processing
- No database queries during filter execution (uses cached options)
- No impact on non-3D file uploads
