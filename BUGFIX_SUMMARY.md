# WP 3D Model Viewer - Bug Fixes Applied

## Issue Resolution

The reported error:
```
PHP Fatal error: Failed opening required '/path/to/wp-content/plugins/wp-3d-model-viewer/includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php'
```

This error typically occurs when:
1. Plugin files are incomplete or missing
2. Incorrect folder structure during installation
3. File permission issues
4. Corrupted files during upload

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Main Plugin File (`wp-3d-model-viewer.php`)

- Added file existence checks before requiring core files
- Added graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added safety checks for activation/deactivation functions
- Added class existence check before instantiation

### 2. Improved Dependency Loading (`includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php`)

- Added file existence checks in `load_dependencies()` method
- Added class existence check before instantiating the loader
- Made dependency loading more robust against missing files

### 3. File Integrity Check (`includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer-activator.php`)

- Added `check_file_integrity()` method to verify all required files exist
- Plugin activation will fail gracefully if files are missing
- Provides clear error message to user about reinstallation

### 4. Debug Tools

- Created `debug-plugin.php` for troubleshooting file issues
- Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with comprehensive installation guide

## Files Modified

1. `wp-3d-model-viewer.php` - Main plugin file with enhanced error handling
2. `includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer.php` - Core class with improved dependency loading
3. `includes/class-wp-3d-model-viewer-activator.php` - Activator with file integrity check

## Files Added

1. `debug-plugin.php` - Debug utility for file existence checking
2. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
3. `BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Installation Verification

After uploading the fixed plugin:

1. Ensure the plugin folder is named exactly `wp-3d-model-viewer`
2. Verify all required files exist (see TROUBLESHOOTING.md for complete list)
3. Check file permissions (folders: 755, files: 644)
4. If issues persist, run `debug-plugin.php` to identify specific problems

## Prevention

The enhanced error handling will now:
- Prevent fatal errors from missing files
- Show helpful admin notices instead of white screens
- Allow partial functionality even if some files are missing
- Provide clear guidance for resolving issues

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Upload the plugin to WordPress
2. Try to activate it
3. If files are missing, you should see a helpful error message instead of a fatal error
4. If activation succeeds, the plugin should work normally

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible and do not affect:
- Existing plugin functionality
- Database structure
- User settings
- Shortcode syntax
- API compatibility

The fixes only add safety checks and better error handling without changing core functionality.
