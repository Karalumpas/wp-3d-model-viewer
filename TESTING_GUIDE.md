# Testing the Enhanced WP 3D Model Viewer

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive 3D Model Preview in Admin
- **Location**: When editing a 3D Model post in WordPress admin
- **Functionality**: Live preview of the 3D model with camera controls
- **Benefits**: No more guessing rotation values!

### 2. Camera Position Capture
- **How it works**: 
  1. Upload a 3D model file (.glb, .gltf, etc.)
  2. Use the interactive preview to rotate, zoom, and position the model
  3. Click "Capture Current Position" to save the perfect view
  4. The saved position will be used when displaying the model on the frontend

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Card-based layout with better visual hierarchy
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual status indicators show when positions are captured
- **Better Controls**: Intuitive sliders and buttons instead of text inputs

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. WordPress installation (5.0+)
2. PHP 7.4+
3. Modern browser with WebGL support

### Step-by-Step Testing

1. **Install the Plugin**
   - Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`
   - Activate in WordPress admin

2. **Create a New 3D Model**
   - Go to `3D Models > Add New`
   - Upload a 3D model file (download samples from [Khronos glTF samples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models))

3. **Test the Interactive Preview**
   - Once a model is uploaded, you'll see the interactive preview
   - Rotate the model by dragging
   - Zoom with mouse wheel
   - Pan by holding shift and dragging

4. **Capture Camera Position**
   - Position the model as desired
   - Click "Capture Current Position"
   - Watch the status indicator turn green

5. **Test on Frontend**
   - Save the 3D model post
   - Copy the shortcode from the metabox
   - Add it to a page or post
   - View the page - the model should load with your saved position

### Sample Shortcode Usage

```php
[model_viewer id="123"]
```

Or with custom parameters:
```php
[3d_model_viewer src="/path/to/model.glb" camera_controls="true" ar="true"]
```

## Error Handling

- If no model file is uploaded, a helpful notice is shown
- JavaScript gracefully handles missing model-viewer library
- PHP syntax validation passes for all files
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Browser Support

- **Desktop**: Chrome 66+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 12+, Chrome Android 66+
- **WebXR/AR**: Varies by device and browser

## Performance Considerations

- Model-viewer library loads asynchronously
- Lazy loading enabled by default
- Responsive images and optimized CSS
- No jQuery dependencies for the 3D functionality

## Troubleshooting

**Model not loading in admin preview:**
1. Check if the model file URL is accessible
2. Verify file format is supported (.glb, .gltf, .obj, etc.)
3. Check browser console for errors

**Position not saving:**
1. Ensure model is fully loaded before capturing
2. Check that JavaScript is enabled
3. Verify user has edit permissions

**Frontend display issues:**
1. Check shortcode syntax
2. Verify model file still exists
3. Test in different browsers

## Future Enhancements

- Drag & drop model file upload
- Animation controls for animated models
- Multiple camera position presets
- AR marker customization
- Model optimization suggestions
